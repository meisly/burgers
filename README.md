# [Eat-da-Burger](https://hidden-caverns-60875.herokuapp.com/)


Eat-da-Burger allows you to add burgers to a list and then later mark them as devoured. Eat-da-Burger is a single-page web application that I have hosted on Heroku, using the JawsDB MySQL database on the backend.  Express.js serves web requests with Handlebars.js as the templating engine.


# Deployed
